                <h1>Date: 15/02/3.39</h1>
                <p>A castle that floats in the sky. Massive chains that run from the ground at my feet to the dirt that
                    supports the castle. The chains stretch and pull like it's what's keeping the castle from floating
                    away into the sky, even though there's was nothing to propel the castle upwards. Not that there
                    could
                    be.
                </p>

                <p>Not that there should be.</p>

                <h1>Date: 2/42/3.40</h1>
                <p> Water's everywhere. Past the horizon, past what I strain my eyes to see, it's all just blue. Not
                    even the
                    tiniest stray branch juts from its surface. None of it's probably drinkable. I can only be grateful
                    it doesn't go past my knees.
                    Gravity's heavier than what I'm used to. As well as this suit, it feels like walking through
                    quicksand.
                    Could've been worse. Seen worse. Been in worse.
                </p>

                    God, I'm tired.
