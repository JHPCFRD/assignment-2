                <p>A castle that floats in the sky. Massive chains that run from the ground at my feet to the dirt that
                    supports the castle. The chains stretch and pull like they're about to break, yet there's nothing
                    keeping the castle from dropping to the ground; nothing that is propelling the castle upwards. Not
                    that there
                    could be.
                </p>

                <p>Not that there should be.</p>
            </li>

                <h3>Date: 02/42/3.40</h3>
                <p> Water's everywhere. Past the horizon, past what I strain my eyes to see, it's nothing but blue. Not
                    even the
                    tiniest stray branch juts from its surface. None of it's probably drinkable. I can only be grateful
                    it doesn't go past my knees.
                    Gravity's heavier than what I'm used to. That and this suit, it feels like walking through
                    quicksand.
                    Could've been worse. Seen worse. Been in worse.
                </p>

                    God, I'm tired.
